# Sample codes

This is the implementation sample codes of triple encryption.
You can find that in [src](./src)

## Verification

Here is an example to check if the implementation of decryption is correct.

_Given a **secret key** `aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff` and a **IV key** `a1b2c3d4`,
The decryption result should match as following:_

| hash | price value |
| -- | -- |
| IuaFxmm4JA | 69.1234 |
| IGXJfDRFrw | 48.1234 |
| JAfb3w | 0.05 |
| IvFHoQCd | 6.1234 |
| JAfb0kw | 0.089 |
| JAfb0kzC | 0.0898 |
| JA | 0 |
| JSLJKrfWKA | 12.1234 |
| JAfb | 0.0 |
